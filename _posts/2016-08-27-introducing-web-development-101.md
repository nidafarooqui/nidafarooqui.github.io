### Writing is hard.

Especially when you're not sure what to write about.

But if you keep putting it off because you're waiting for the right moment when the spark finally hits you and you're overloaded with ideas on web development topics galore --- well, that'll never happen.

At least not to me.

So I'm just going to start off by writing from the very beginning on what I know about web development.

This'll probably be a long series but it will be unassuming (hopefully) to the reader, pretending you don't know anything about web development.

When you talk about web development, the problem arises, well, where do you begin?

Do you start from the very beginning and cover HTML and CSS or do you skip all the design part and dive in straight to coding?

Well I haven't figured out that out just yet. I think I'll do it as we go along but we will dive head first and deep into programming through projects.


### The Plan
I'm going to make a bold statement here and say I will plan a project (a mini one) and develop it here, helping you get familiar with the language and on developing web apps.

But before we do that, let's start by picking a language. Or two.

I'm picking Javascript and Ruby because I love Javascript and coding in Ruby on Rails is easy and helps develop best practices. After that I plan to dive into Node and cover full stack javascript development in the future.

## Introducing Web Development 101

Hello web.

Let's begin with our first mini project.

#### A Landing Page

No Ruby here. Just plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Our task will be to build a landing page that fulfils the following requirements I got from a senior developer.

*Goals For The Landing Page:*

- Inform visitors about the app and how it can help them.
- Convert visitors to signup for a newsletter/notification about the upcoming closed beta of the app.
- Lastly convert visitors to social media followers for updates and engagement.

*Possible Steps Needed To Achieve Goals:*

- Content Development
- Sketch a Wireframe _(Using Paper or Whiteboard or Software)_
- Design & Develop
- Extensive Testing

*Constraints:*

- Time-limit: 7 Days
- Must use Git
- Must use Responsive Design

Let's break this down into actionable steps or blocks that need to be build.

(At least that's how I process information.)

#### Requirements
1. A signup bar that takes in email addresses and redirects them to a thank you page.
2. Slide in animated information about the features of the app
3. Social media buttons

#### Additional Rules
1. Must use testing
2. Must be responsive
3. Must have wireframes.

I know some people write everything all in one post. I just can't do that.

So I'm going to make each block that needs to be build a blog post and cover how I build it starting with the design phase.
