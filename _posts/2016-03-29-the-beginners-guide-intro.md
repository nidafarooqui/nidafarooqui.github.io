<div class="message"> Welcome to The Beginner's Guide to Web Development. A series of posts where I talk about the best places to learn web development. </div>


### Introduction

In this guide, we will cover basic web development - enough to get you started in building small and simple websites. We will go over the following lessons in order.

1. HTML & CSS
2. Javascript Introduction
3. jQuery
4. jQuery & Ajax
5. The Final Project

This course assumes you have no knowledge of programming or have very little programming experience.

### Lesson 1 - HTML & CSS


<strong>Step 1</strong>

* It's best to start with HTML & CSS. If you are completely new to programming head over to [Code Academy](https://codeacademy.com) and start off with their *HTML & CSS* course.

* Then complete their *Make a Website* course.

If you are already familiar with HTML & CSS, skip to Step 2.

<strong>Step 2</strong>

Go over these three in order:

* [HTML Dog](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/)
* [Learn To Code in HTML and CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
* [Learn To Code Advanced HTML and CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/)

Don't just read or skim through these websites. Do the examples yourself and build along with them. If you feel you need more practice (I know I did), head over to [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css) and do their project.

Try doing both the easy and the difficult version. Don't overdo it though. You'll get more practice later. Trust me for now and do just these.

*Estimated Time: 3 weeks or less.*

That's it for HTML and CSS. Next lesson I am going to introduce you to Javascript.
