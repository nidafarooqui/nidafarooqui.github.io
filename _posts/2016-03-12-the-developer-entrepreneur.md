<div class="message"> Welcome to the developer entrepreneur blog series where you receive weekly lessons on building your own startup. </div>

Before you read on, I’m going to tell you this. This isn’t geared towards everyone.

If you don’t care about web development, trust me, this site isn’t for you. I have a different approach here and it is only for the developers or the wanna-be developers who want to build their own startup and live an independent lifestyle.

It's possible and not so hard once you put in the work.

Every week I will Insha Allah set a goal both for myself and you to complete. We’ll be covering a lot of materials ranging from web development to marketing to copywriting for developers. So hang on tight!

Bookmark this tab and tune in next week for your first lesson.
