  Hey there! I'm using this blog to track my progress on learning web development. I mainly talk about what I've learned and the projects I've done to help me get better.
</p>

I have a postgraduate degree in software engineering and I come from a background in C++, Java and C#. I've done an occasional amount of PHP which piqued my interest in web development and a few months later I decided to teach myself full stack development. How long this will take me I cannot say, but I do not intend to sprint through it in 3 months so it could take longer. My current goal is to master front-end development before tackling back-end head on.

I've made a list of [curated resources](/Resources) I've used to teach myself full stack development. Feel free to share them.
