  Hey there! Feel free to read my sob story or skip ahead to the awesome list of curated resources I share on full stack web development.
</p>

I decided to get better at developing apps. I knew C++ and a bit of HTML. It was the year 2011. I graduated as a computer engineer, confident I was going to get companies begging me to work at their place once I stepped out into the world. Boy was I overconfident.

Reality hit me deep of course.

Turns out, there were a whole other bunch of skills required for me to know when I went through job applications. And there were tons of Ruby on Rails job openings everywhere back then. Why the hell wasn't I taught this at my university?! But I took in a deep breath and hit send anyway (to whatever job I thought I fit). I never heard back from any company.

So I started sending in more resumes to more companies thinking, well, one of them definitely has to respond. After a facing a series of rejections, I made up my mind. Yes, I was gonna change careers.

While wallowing in self-pity, I got a job as a local IT teacher and started saving up for a Master's degree in Software Engineering.

My reasoning? I just needed to learn more and get better. So I got that degree and learned C#, Java, PHP, Android programming, and even games programming through C++.

By the way, I actually did get plenty of job offers after that, but the minute they found out I needed a visa, they backed away. Go figure.

Such is life. But I wasn't going to let myself wallow in self pity again. I had to up my game somehow and I was fortunate enough then, to land an internship at a web development company.

That was when everything changed for me. Or more appropriately, I saw a world of opportunities that I never did before.

And I decided to get deep into web development and the world of startups. That is where you enter and that is what this website is all about. I want to deliver every piece of information, cover every nook and cranny possible on web development so you can build your own startup. I start from the very beginning sharing only what I have used and consider the best. Of course this is all opinionated, so feel free to choose an alternative resource if you have one.

I've made a list of [curated resources](/Resources) I've used to teach myself full stack development. Feel free to share them.
